Excel parser for raw data ingestion using openpyxl.

    Read Excel data from a local file path or URL.

    Args:
        source (str): Path to local file (e.g., "data.xlsx") or
                      HTTP(S) URL (e.g., "http://example.com/data.xlsx").

                                    If None, the function will read *all* sheets.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with this structure:
